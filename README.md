# WDI Project 4: Slack-Bot

My final project allows you to set up a bot that will monitor a Slack channel and serve custom responses. Currently it can play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors and keep a record of your score. I have plans to polish the app up in my free time and add a few features when I am more familiar with the Slack API. 

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- py.test
- virtualenv
- Ngrok
- Slack API

### Thoughts

This project was a big departure from our past projects, both in scope and direction. Our final project offered us less time to complete than previous ones, and we were given free reign to work on anything that interested us. I think bots are cool and useful, so that is the direction that I went.  

### Test Driven Development

I have heard again and again that every programmer should write tests for their code, but none do. Since I chose a smaller scope project I thought this would be a good time to learn about test driven development. The process of writing tests before writing actual functions for my code was relatively painless, and I'm excited to implement tests into my next project. I did encounter an issue on finding a reliable way to test functions that rely on a random number generator, since their returns were not consistant.
